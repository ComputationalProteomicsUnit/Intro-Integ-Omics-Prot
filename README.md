## Table of content

1. Use case 1: Integration of mass spectrometry based proteomics and
   RNA-Seq transcriptomics - caveats and [mapping](./mapping.md)
2. Use case 2: Combining exerimental spatial proteomics and third-pary
   data using [transfer learning](./transfer-learning.md) to improve
   inference of sub-cellular localisation of proteins.
