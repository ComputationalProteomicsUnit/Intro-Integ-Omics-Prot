# Integrating proteomics data: caveats

## Similarities and differences with high-throughput sequencing data

**Mapping** of
- peptides along protein sequences (although not explicitly considered
  a mapping task)
- short reads along genome coordinates

BUT

1. the protein database and the genome are _independent_, i.e. the
   proteins do not make explicitly reference to the genome they
   originate from.

2. **coverage**: % vs X

```{r cvg, echo=FALSE}
cvg <- data.table::fread("./data/Ensembl_76.csv", skip = 17,
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
summary(cvg$coverage)
```

This has an impact on **protein inference* and **missing values**.
