# Introduction to proteomics

- Introduction to MS-based proteomics, to give participants a fair
  understanding of proteomics data, in terms of quantitation and
  identification.

- Challenges of MS-based proteomics

- What can we assays with proteomics: differential protein expression,
  post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions,
  spatial proteomics.
